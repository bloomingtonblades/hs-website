Updates
-------

Any player who will be missing an on- or off-ice practice should let
Coach Appel know in advance. Practice plans may change based on number
of players attending. Thank you!

Be sure to check the [calendar][cal] for updated practices times and other
changes. Also players and parents should get the [TeamApp mobile
app][teamapp]. Once you install it, create an account and then search
for "Blades HS Hockey" and join! We'll use TeamApp for quick messages
and game-day updates.

Reminder, players are not permitted to drive themselves to away games.
