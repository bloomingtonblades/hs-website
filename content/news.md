2018-19 Roster News
-------------------

**September 19, 2018** --- Below is the USA Hockey Roster for the
Bloomington Blades league team for the 2018-19 season. This roster
reflects all players that will be eligible to play for the "Blue" team
throughout the course of the season. Being on this list does not mean
that you will be eligible for the state tournament as the roster must
be reduced to 21 total by December 31 and players must meet the minimum
criteria of 50% league games and 6 crossovers. Not all of the players
on this list will dress for blue team games. This will remain a fluid
roster for some time as players prove themselves on and off the ice
*and in the classroom*. The roster was developed through thorough
evaluation by coaching staff and impartial observers over the
weekend. I will discuss this in more detail on Friday at the team
event but this should serve as a motivator for many players to either
gain or *MAINTAIN* a spot on the 21 player roster in December.

I applaud the efforts of our Board to maintain the number of players
we have in our program. Players not on the final roster will have
every opportunity to develop over the course of the season as I coach
all players, not just the blue team. The groundwork laid this year
will benefit the program for years to come.

Given annually since 2003 to the team with the highest cumulative
grade point average, the Henry G. Schallert Team Academic Award is
named in honor of the father of Nate Schallert, one of the ISHSHAâ€™s
longest serving volunteers. The senior Mr. Schallert was an educator
his entire life.

The team collectively achieved a 3.51 GPA, with two-thirds of the team
earning a 3.6 or higher. Special recognition goes to Sophomore
Ian Knox who leads the team with a GPA of 4.19, and Senior Sam Burris
who will graduate with a GPA above 4.0.

The Blades will receive recognition in the official program of the
