<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Dropping the Puck On Cancer - Blades vs Carmel" src="dtphs.jpg"></div>

Thanks for joining us for the first ever High School version of
[Collegiate Charities][cc] Dropping the Puck on Cancer series on Saturday,
October 21. It was a fun afternoon for everyone, for a great cause.

Look for a possibly expanded, multi-game format next year!

For a limited time, you can still order an exclusive,
made-for-this-game custom Blades hockey jersey! [Order
online][jerseys]. These will make great holiday gifts!

Updates
-------

Any player who will be missing an on- or off-ice practice should let
Coach Appel know in advance. Practice plans may change based on number
of players attending. Thank you!

Be sure to check the [calendar][cal] for updated practices times and other
changes. Also players and parents should get the [TeamApp mobile
app][teamapp]. Once you install it, create an account and then search
for "Blades HS Hockey" and join! We'll use TeamApp for quick messages
and game-day updates.

Reminder, players are not permitted to drive themselves to away games.
