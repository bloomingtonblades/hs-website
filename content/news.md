Registration
------------
Area high school students intending to play in the 2017&ndash;2018 season
should register as soon as possible using our [online registration
form][form]. Registration deadline is July 30.

Player/Parent Meeting
---------------------
Parents and players should plan to attend our kickoff/orientation
meeting on Sunday, July 30, 4:00&ndash;6:00pm at the Clubhouse at [Basswood
Apartments <span class="icon fa-map-marker"></span>][basswood].
We'll provide a lot of information about the upcoming
season&mdash;there are some changes in both the program and the league
this year so it's important to attend.

At the meeting we will ask each family to complete a financial
agreement and pay a $200 deposit which will apply to your season
program fees. We are still fine-tuning the budget, but we expect fees
to be fairly close to what they were last year.

The deposit payment, and all registrations complete, will be required
before your player can begin practice.
