Blades Spirit Wear
------------------

Our friends at TIS put together this [nifty order form][spiritwear]
for all your Blades spirit wear needs.

Just go to [HollowayUSA.com](https://www.hollowayusa.com/) and find
stuff you like. Enter order number, size, color, embroidery
preferences on the form. Return the form to [Jay Baer <span class="icon fa-envelope-o"></span>](mailto:jbaer@bloomingtonblades.com)
by August 31. He'll place the order, collect your money, and get your stuff to you when it arrives.

Also available, but not on the order form (different vendor)
are the cool Blades caps. Dark blue with the varsity “B” on front,
and Bloomington Blades in white on the back.
These are super comfy. $25 each. They are flex fit and come in S/M and L/XL sizes.
If you’d like a hat, please let Jay know and he’ll get those ordered too. 

This is the one ordering window for team merchandise, so please don’t miss the August 31 deadline.
