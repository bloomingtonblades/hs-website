Blades Win State Academic Honors
--------------------------------
February 23, 2018 --- For the first time in program history, the

Given annually since 2003 to the team with the highest cumulative
grade point average, the Henry G. Schallert Team Academic Award is
named in honor of the father of Nate Schallert, one of the ISHSHAâ€™s
longest serving volunteers. The senior Mr. Schallert was an educator
his entire life.

The team collectively achieved a 3.51 GPA, with two-thirds of the team
earning a 3.6 or higher. Special recognition goes to Sophomore
Ian Knox who leads the team with a GPA of 4.19, and Senior Sam Burris
who will graduate with a GPA above 4.0.

The Blades will receive recognition in the official program of the
state tournament. A plaque will be given to the captains before our
