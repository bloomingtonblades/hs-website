New SafeSport requirements
--------------------------

**June 24, 2019** --- You may have seen recent emails from USA Hockey
describing some of the changes to the SafeSport program for this
season. One that we want to highlight is that any _player_ who will be
17 or older by the end of 2019 must complete the online SafeSport
training that other adults in the program are required to
complete. This is mandated by new laws affecting USA Hockey and the US
Center for SafeSport starting this season.

What does this mean? **It means that if you were born in 2002 or
earlier, you must complete the online Core Center for SafeSport
Training course before you can practice, play, or be added to a team
roster**. Since our practices start in August, we are setting a deadline
of July 28 (the date of our pre-season team meeting) for this.

**Step 1**: If not already done, you and your parent(s) must complete
  and pay for your USA Hockey player registration at
  [https://membership.usahockey.com](https://membership.usahockey.com).

**Step 2**: Using your registration confirmation number, register for
  and complete the SafeSport training as described here:
  [https://www.usahockey.com/trainingregistration](https://www.usahockey.com/trainingregistration).

There is no additional cost for the training beyond your regular USA
Hockey registration fees. Plan for it to take 90 - 120 minutes to
complete. It does not have to be completed all at once. You can leave
and come back later if you don't have time to finish it in one
session.

Again, **if you were born in 2002 or earlier you must complete this
training before you can practice or play**. Thanks for your
cooperation. Please do not put this off. We have no leeway in granting
exceptions to this new requirement, as it is being enforced at the
national level.

**December 12, 2018** --- Congratulations to the following players selected as 2018 Hoosier League All-Stars!

All-Star events start at 2:00pm on
Saturday, December 22 in Fishers at the [Fuel Tank <span class="icon
fa-map-marker"></span>][fuel] (players please arrive by 1:00pm, and bring both light and dark jerseys). 


Blades Win State Academic Honors
--------------------------------
**February 23, 2018** --- For the first time in program history, the
Bloomington Blades have won the Henry G. Schallert Team Academic Award
from the Indiana State High School Hockey Association.

Given annually since 2003 to the team with the highest cumulative
grade point average, the Henry G. Schallert Team Academic Award is
named in honor of the father of Nate Schallert, one of the ISHSHAâ€™s
longest serving volunteers. The senior Mr. Schallert was an educator
his entire life.

The team collectively achieved a 3.51 GPA, with two-thirds of the team
earning a 3.6 or higher. Special recognition goes to Sophomore
Ian Knox who leads the team with a GPA of 4.19, and Senior Sam Burris
who will graduate with a GPA above 4.0.

The Blades will receive recognition in the official program of the
state tournament. A plaque will be given to the captains before our
second game of the tournament, 10:30am Saturday, March 3 on the
Charles W. "Lefty" Smith Jr. rink at the University of Notre Dame.
