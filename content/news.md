2019-20 Registration and Practices
----------------------------------
**June 20, 2019** --- Registration for the 2019&ndash;20 season is open!

Please help by using our [online registration form][register] to
register your player(s) as soon as possible. We will be ordering
jerseys and other apparel very soon.

Columbus practices for August and September are already scheduled and
on the [team calendar][cal]. Players are not permitted to drive
themselves to Columbus practices, but we will organize
carpools.

Attendance at these early practices is mandatory. If you have
unavoidable conflicts such as participation in another high school
fall sport, please inform us in advance.

We are again fortunate to be able to roster two teams this
season. Team placement will be determined based upon player
evaluations during the initial practice weeks, so it is important to
attend. Both teams will play in the Hoosier League regular season and
league tournament. The Blue team will play in the Championship
Division and the White team will play in the Commissioner
division. The Blue team will additionally enter in the ISHSAA state
championship invitational tournament.

All players and parents must also attend our pre-season meeting on
Sunday, July 28 at 5:00pm at the [Basswood Apartments Clubhouse <span
class="icon fa-map-marker"></span>][basswood]. All players, please
bring your final report card from last school year.
